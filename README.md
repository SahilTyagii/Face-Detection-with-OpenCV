# Face-Detection-with-OpenCV


This Python script utilizes the OpenCV library for real-time face and eye detection using Haar cascades. It captures video from the default webcam and applies face and eye detection algorithms to detect faces and eyes in the video stream.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2) library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/SahilTyagii/Face-Detection-with-OpenCV.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd Face-Detection-with-OpenCV
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the Python script:

   ```
   python face-detection.py
   ```

2. The script will open a window displaying the webcam feed with face and eye detection overlay.

3. To exit the application, press `q`.
